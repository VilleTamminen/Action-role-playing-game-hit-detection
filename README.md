This project was a result of my thesis and it focuses on making hit detection system for action RPGs.
2 Solutions. First solution focused on making a working hit detection system with multiple combat mechanics. 
Solution 2 reworked first solution to be simpler and more expandable for future. Use solution 2 for your projects.
Includes target differentiating (differentiate friend from foe) and dealing damage to targets.
