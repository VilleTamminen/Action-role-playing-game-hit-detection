# Hit detection system for action role-playing games
This project was a result of my thesis and it focuses on making a hit detection system for action RPGs.
2 Solutions. First solution focused on making a working hit detection system with multiple combat mechanics. Attack collision information is passed between weapons and characters.
Solution 2 reworked first solution to be simpler and more expandable for future. Attack collision is managed in weapons. Use solution 2 for your projects.
Includes target differentiating (differentiate friend from foe) and dealing damage to targets.
